# Prerequisite 
- Openshift Cluster (Tested with 4.15.13+ version)
- The Advanced Cluster Management operator should be installed on the hub cluster to facilitate cluster administration and data aggregation(Tested with 2.10.4 version).
- [MCO](https://github.com/stolostron/multicluster-observability-operator/) should be installed into the hub cluster. 
- `oc` CLI should be installed and configured to interact with Openshift cluster


# Steps to Enable ACM Right Sizing Dev Preview 

For enabling ACM Right Sizing Dev Preview, we need to add Prometheus recording rule as well as [custom allowlist](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.10/html/observability/customizing-observability#adding-custom-metrics) to each managed clusters.     

### Step 1: Login into Openshift Cluster

From the terminal, login into ACM hub cluster environment using login command. You can easily get it form the Hub cluster Console UI.  

```
oc login --token=*** --server=***
```

### Step 2: Setup ManagedClusterSetBinding
We need a **ManagedClusterSet** and a **ManagedClusterSetBinding** to ensure that the `Placement` can select clusters. If you already have these, you can skip this step (you can use the existing ManagedClusterSet in **Step 4**). Otherwise, you can create a ManagedClusterSet and bind it to the `default` namespace using the command below.    

```
oc apply -f data-assets/rs-managedclustersetbinding.yaml
```

**Assign Clusters to the ManagedClusterSet**: You can assign multiple clusters to the created ManagedClusterSet either through the ACM UI by navigating to `/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/sets/details/rs-cluster-set/manage-resources` after the host URL, or by using the sample command below. 

```
for cluster in $(echo "local-cluster,cluster2,cluster3" | tr ',' ' '); do oc label managedcluster "$cluster" cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=rs-cluster-set --overwrite; done
```
* Replace `rs-cluster-set` if you are using any existing ManagedClusterSet.
* Also update list of comma separated clusters in above command `local-cluster,cluster2,cluster3`.  


### Step 3: Deploy Policy 

We will utilize [Policy](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.10/html/governance/governance#policy-overview) to deploy **Recording rule** as well as **custom allowlist** to each managed clusters. 

We have created sample policy for the Prometheus Recording Rule, you can find it [here](../data-assets/rs-rules-policy.yaml). Using below command you can deploy policy to Hub cluster.  

```
oc apply -f data-assets/rs-rules-policy.yaml
```

You can customize the cluster/namespace filter criteria based on need. Below are sample criteria used in the file where we exclude namespaces that start with `openshift` or `xyz`. Also including namespace where label is `empty` or contains `prod` or `dev` label.

- `namespace!~'openshift.*|xyz.*'`
- `(kube_namespace_labels{label_env=~"prod|dev"} or kube_namespace_labels{label_env=''})`


Similar way you can deploy custom allowlist policy, you can find sample [here](../data-assets/rs-allowlist-policy.yaml)
```
oc apply -f data-assets/rs-allowlist-policy.yaml
```

### Step 4: Adding Policies to PolicySet
Now, apply the [Policy Configurations](../data-assets/rs-policyset.yaml) using the command below to enable these policies across the fleet. This will include the PolicySet, PlacementBinding, and Placement.
```
oc apply -f data-assets/rs-policyset.yaml
```
**Notes**:
* You can change the `clusterSet` if you want to use any existing ManagedClusterSet. 
* There are different ways to filter specific clusters that are part of the created ManagedClusterSet. Use the sample configurations below along with the `clusterSets` configuration in the `Placement` to achieve the same. 
  * We can use **predicates** in the `Placement` to filter only a few clusters from the ManagedClusterSet based on labels: 
    ```
      predicates:
        - requiredClusterSelector:
            labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                environment: dev   # Select clusters with this label
    ```
    In the example above, we are selecting only the clusters labeled `environment: dev`
  * we can also use **clusterSelector** to select managed clusters based on label expressions. See the example below:
    ```
    clusterSelector:                            
        matchExpressions:
          - key: hive.openshift.io/managed
            operator: In
            values:
              - true
    ```
    In this example, we define that only clusters with the label `hive.openshift.op/managed=true` will have the policy applied.
  * You can also use **clusterConditions** to filter only few managed clusters based on their status:
    ```
    clusterConditions:
    - status: "True"
      type: ManagedClusterConditionAvailable
    ```
    In this example, we are selecting all the managed clusters where the `ManagedClusterConditionAvailable` status is `True`.

### Step 5: Deploy Grafana Dashboard

[Here](../data-assets/acm_right_sizing_grafana_dashboard.yaml) is the yaml file that contains configuration of ACM Right-Sizing grafana dashboard. Use the following command to add this dashboard on Grafana. 

```
oc create -f data-assets/acm_right_sizing_grafana_dashboard.yaml
```


### Step 5: Access Grafana Dashboard

Wait for some time for the Prometheus Recording Rules to get triggered, and we will have some data points. You can then go to Grafana and search for the `ACM Right-Sizing Namespace` dashboard. Click on it, and you are ready to use ACM Right Sizing solution.
